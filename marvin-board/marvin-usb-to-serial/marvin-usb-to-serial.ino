 * marvin-usb-to-serial.ino
 * 
 * This sketch is specific for the Marvin board:
 * https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/688158475/marvin-the-lora-development-board
 * 
 * It establishes a serial communication over the UART interface between the
 * ATmega32u4 and the RN2483 module, so it can be configured with the LoRaWan keys.
 * This code is a 1:1 port of the original code "usb-to-serial.ino" for the
 * Marvin board (http://kck.st/2fdp9aa). Only the pins have been changed to
 * comply with the layout of the board and the microcontroller.
 * 
 * To flash the Marvin board, on the Arduino IDE, head to "Tools" -> "Boards",
 * and select Arduino Leonardo instead.
